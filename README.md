# MCDII - Mars Climate Database Improved Interface

## This is a re-designed version of the Mars Climate Database(MCD) available at http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/

The goal of this design is to provide a clearer and more user friendly interface for the Mars Climate Database,
a fantastic project developed and organized by Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique du CNRS (Paris, France) in collaboration with the Open University (UK), the Oxford University (UK) and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (Spain) with support from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).

## New Interface

I have heard from several people that this fantastic tool lacks of an intuitive and handy interface.
So as a side project I decided to fully re-write it, still based on the hosted version of the database available at http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/
used as an 'API'.
